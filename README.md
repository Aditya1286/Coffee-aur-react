# Coffee aur React 🚀

This repository contains a basic React application built as part of the "Coffee aur React" learning journey. It's designed to help beginners get hands-on with React fundamentals like components, state, and event handling.

## 📖 About

This project is part of my React learning journey, following the comprehensive React tutorial series. The repository demonstrates practical implementation of React concepts through real-world examples and projects.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

- Understanding React fundamentals
- Component-based architecture
- State management
- Event handling
- Props and data flow
- React hooks (useState, useEffect, etc.)
- Modern JavaScript (ES6+)
- Project structure and best practices

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **React** - Frontend library
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** - Programming language
- **HTML5** - Markup language
- **CSS3** - Styling
- **Vite** - Build tool (if applicable)
- **Node.js** - Runtime environment

## 🚀 Getting Started
